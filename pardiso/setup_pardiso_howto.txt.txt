Nirfast should be configured to detect and run pardiso on a properly equipped cluster.  The only thing you need to do is edit or create
a .bash_profile file in your home directory.  The below is an example of this file - you will just need to change the path in the second line.


# this is the directory where the custom mkl lbrary file should go
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"/thayerfs/research/NIR/yourpath/NIRFAST/toolbox/pardiso"

# this is for running matlab compiled scripts
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:\
/thayerfs/apps/matlab/sys/os/glnxa64:\
/thayerfs/apps/matlab/bin/glnxa64:\
/thayerfs/apps/matlab/runtime/glnxa64:\
/thayerfs/apps/matlab/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/native_threads:\
/thayerfs/apps/matlab/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/server:\
/thayerfs/apps/matlab/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64
export XAPPLRESDIR=/thayerfs/apps/matlab/X11/app-defaults
